## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile is flexible and iterative, allowing continuous improvements and frequent customer feedback. It works best for dynamic projects but requires strong collaboration and can lead to scope creep. Waterfall is linear and structured, making it easier to manage budgets and timelines. It suits projects with fixed requirements but is rigid and slow to adapt to changes. Agile delivers value faster, while Waterfall ensures stability and clear documentation. Use Agile for evolving needs and Waterfall for well-defined projects.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is best for projects with evolving requirements, frequent changes, and high customer involvement. Examples include software startups, mobile apps, e-commerce platforms, and AI-based products. It allows quick iterations and continuous feedback.  

Waterfall suits projects with fixed requirements, strict regulations, and clear deliverables. Examples include government systems, banking software, and medical devices. It ensures thorough planning, documentation, and compliance.  

Use Agile for flexibility and innovation, and Waterfall for stability and predictability.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

### **Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance**

3. **Code Reviews** – Conduct peer reviews to catch issues early.  
4. **Version Control** – Use Git or similar tools to track changes and prevent errors.  
5. **Agile QA Practices** – Implement test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD).  
6. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Ensure the software meets user needs before deployment.  
7. **Performance Testing** – Check for speed, scalability, and reliability under different loads.  
8. **Security Testing** – Identify vulnerabilities and protect against cyber threats.  

### **Importance of High Standards**  
- **Prevents Bugs** – Reduces costly fixes after deployment.  
- **Enhances User Experience** – Ensures smooth and efficient performance.  
- **Boosts Reputation** – Reliable software builds customer trust.
